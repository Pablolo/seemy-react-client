# Seemy - React Client

## Description

Seemy is a platform that puts in contact people who has sports & luxury cars with those who want to rent them for a few days. Think about it as a 'Getaround' app, but only focused on high-end cars.

There will be two types of users: owners and renters. Both will have to register. 

* __Owners__ will be able to add their cars on the platform, edit and delete them.
* __Renters__ will be able to browse through all cars, search by name and book them on their desired date.
